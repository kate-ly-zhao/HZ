As part of my co-op term at HZ University of Applied Sciences, I partook in the Added Value with Mussels Project that aimed to examine factors affecting the establishment and long term survival of littoral mussel beds in the Eastern Scheldt. 

Experiments were previously established with fixed and random factors - these included substrate (sand beds, oyster shell, and net), the type of protection (wavebreakers), and the location. Mussel survival was examined in addition to their size and mass.

I completed data measurements in the lab, and wrote a R script for ANOVA and GLMM analysis to determine survival.
